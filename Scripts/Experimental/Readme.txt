This is to let us work on some scripts together if difficulties arise, keeping them separate from the _OLD folder.
If you run into a problem and need another scriptor to check but they are not on, upload it here, and give a description of the problem in the header.
When the script has been fixed, edit the header of the script stating that it was fixed, and the original person working on it should remove it from this folder.
Use with fusion scripts only and not any personal ones at the moment.

This also serves as a way to work on a script and then move it into _OLD later, overwriting if necessary.  Like the name says, it's all experimental.
